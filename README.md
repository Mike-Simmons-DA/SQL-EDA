Exploratory Data Analysis on World Layoffs

Overview   
This repository contains the code and documentation for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on world layoffs. The analysis aims to explore trends, patterns, and insights into layoffs worldwide using publicly available data sources.

Dataset  
The dataset used for this analysis is [provide dataset name or source]. It includes information on layoffs across different industries, regions, and time periods.

Analysis  
The EDA is conducted using Postgresql. The analysis is divided into the following steps:

Exploratory Analysis: Exploring the dataset through many different lenses I was able to look at companies that had the most layoffs by number and by percentage. It was interesting to see that companies with most layoffs by percentage were 
almost always startup companies. It was stunning to see one outlier company that made up to 2 billion dollars had only 1 employee which is indicative of laying off everyone except the owner of the company. Likewise, companies with the 
least number of layoffs seemed to be very well established. Along with this I decided to look at companies who had the most layoffs per year as well as per month.
